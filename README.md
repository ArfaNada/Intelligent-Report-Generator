# Intelligent Report Generator

This project is designed to generate intelligent reports using deep learning and data preprocessing techniques. It includes data cleaning, merging, and advanced modeling with BiLSTM architectures.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main application script.
- `cleaned_dataset.csv`: Cleaned dataset used for modeling.
- `merged_electronics_dataset.csv`: Merged dataset for electronics data.
- `DL_Project_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing and exploration.
- `Preliminary_Results/`: Folder containing preliminary results and experiments.
  - `BiLSTM_Mistral.ipynb`: Notebook for BiLSTM model experiments.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/inesmrad/Intelligent-Report-Generator.git
   cd Intelligent-Report-Generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
   - Install required packages (if any, e.g., pandas, numpy, torch, etc.).
   - You can use pip or conda as needed.

3. **Run the application:**
   - Use `app.py` as the entry point for the main functionality.
   - Explore the notebooks for data preprocessing and modeling steps.

## Notebooks

- **DL_Project_Preprocessing.ipynb**: Data cleaning, merging, and feature engineering.
- **Preliminary_Results/BiLSTM_Mistral.ipynb**: Deep learning experiments with BiLSTM models.

## Data

- `cleaned_dataset.csv` and `merged_electronics_dataset.csv` are provided for experimentation and model training.

## Results

- Preliminary results and model outputs are stored in the `Preliminary_Results/` directory.
